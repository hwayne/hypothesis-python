RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release provides what should be a substantial performance improvement to
numpy arrays generated using :ref:`provided numpy support <hypothesis-numpy>`,
and adds a new ``fill_value`` argument to :func:`~hypothesis.extra.numpy.arrays`
to control this behaviour.

This work was funded by `Stripe <https://stripe.com/>`_.
